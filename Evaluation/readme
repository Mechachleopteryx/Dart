Performance Evaluation

0. Please type 'make' to compile the three performance evaluation programs.
Usage: $make

1. FluxEva: It is used to estimate the accuracy of read alignments of
simualted datasets. It checks each alignment coordinate and compares with
the actual transcript-level coordinate. It does not consider alignments with
MAPQ = 0.

Simualted datasets generated by Flux can be downloaded at
http://bioapp.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~arith/Dart/SimData/

Usage: $./FluxEva <SamFile>

Experiment results can be downloaded at
http://bioapp.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~arith/Dart/Results/

2. eva: It is used to estimate the sensitivity and sequence identity of read
alignments of all datasets. It parses the CIGAR field and rebuild the pairwise
sequence alignment between the read sequence and the target genome. The
target genome is hg38.fa by default (hg38.fa can be downloaded at
http://bioapp.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~arith/Dart/Evalution/).

Usage: $./eva <SamFile>

3. SJ_Eva: It is used to estimate the accuracy of splice junction
predictions of each aligner. It reads the real splice junctions
(junctions.txt) and checks each predicted splice junction whether it is
within the boundary of real splice junctions by 5 base pairs.

Usage: $./SJ_Eva <SJ_file>
